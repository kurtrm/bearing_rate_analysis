# bearing_rate_analysis
Repository for exploring the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to predict a ship's speed, course, and range using only bearing and bearing rate over time.

...this is not a plausible application.

A more pragmatic approach would be classifying ships based on geographic location,
blade-rate, engine RPMs, max speed, etc.

Another idea is getting ship aspect and status based on navigation light orientations.
